          The single most common trend between successful businesses is the ability to find a unique niche and provide value to that niche.

        Finding a viable niche can be one of the most difficult challenges an entrepreneur will face.
        There are plenty of areas to get some inspiration for your market:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Hobbies</li>
          <li>Personal Interests</li>
          <li>Sports, Academics, Lifestyles</li>
          <li>Home Improvement</li>
          <li>Specific Car/Boat/ATV/Hunting groups or specialties</li>
          <li>Local Businesses</li>
          <li>Entrepreneurs, Inventors, and Engineers</li>
          <li>Markets with desire for customization</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>Once you have a potential niche (or several) selected, you need to decide whether you'd like to focus on <a href="#">working with clients
        to create original designs </a> or edit existing designs, or if you'd prefer to <a href="#">create your own products and monitize them</a>.
        It is quite possible (and reccomended in fact) to start with a mixture of products and services in order to pinpoint the needs
        and wants of your niche and provide the most value possible.</p>

        <h2 id="competition">2. Research The Competition</h2>
        <p>
          No matter what niche you decide to pursue, chances are there will be some form of competition. Many entrepreneurs are discouraged by
            competition, but the reality is that active competition can be one of your <b>most</b> powerful tools. Why reinvent the wheel? If someone
            else is already doing what you want to do (successfully!), that's proof that there's money to be made. All you have to do is provide
            unique tangible value.
